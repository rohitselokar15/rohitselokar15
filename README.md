- 🙎🏼‍♂️ About Me: I'm Rohit Selokar, a web developer who loves making websites look awesome using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I specialize in creating user-friendly experiences with React.js and Tailwind CSS. While I'm all about the front end, I've got some backend skills with Node.js and Express, along with MongoDB for handling data. I recently completed an internship at Qloron Pvt Ltd in Hyderabad, where I worked as a Software Developer Intern. I honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
